It includes the implementation of gender-based validation in CBS for chequebook requisition, system-level checks to ensure correct chequebook type issuance, and database structure enhancements for gender code validation.\n\n##### Executive Summary\nThe solution document outlines the proposal for implementing a personalized pink coloured chequebook issuance system for female corporate salary package customers. This change aims to cater to the specific requirement of banks' customized offerings to female salary package customers, enhancing customer satisfaction and providing a competitive advantage in the female customer segment.\n\n#### Solution Details\n##### Existing Functionality with Process Flow\nThe current chequebook issuance process in CBS operates without gender-based differentiation. The teller initiates a cheque requisition in CBS, and the system validates the account status and eligibility. However, there is no validation linking the gender code to the chequebook type, leading to potential mismatches in product offerings targeted at specific customer segments.\n\n##### Technical Feasibility\nThe proposed solution is technically feasible, as it involves database enhancements and validation logic at multiple checkpoints in the cheque requisition and product code change workflows. The solution can be implemented using existing CBS infrastructure and technology.\n\n##### Proposed Solution Details\nThe proposed solution involves the following key components:\n1. **Database Structure Enhancements:** Add a new validation rule based on the \"Gender Code\" at the time of cheque requisition for female \"Corporate Salary Package (CPS)\" account holders.\n2. **CBS Validations:** The Cheque Requisition System will perform product code eligibility checks, gender code validation, and validation logic to ensure the correct issuance of pink coloured chequebooks to eligible customers.\n3. **Validation Logic:** The system will implement validations at two critical junctures: during product code changes and during cheque requisition.\n4. **User Interface Changes:** The teller interface will be enhanced to display gender-appropriate chequebook options, show validation error messages, and provide prompts during product code conversions.\n\n##### Business Acceptance Scenario\nThe business acceptance criteria include the successful issuance of pink coloured chequebooks to eligible female customers, the prevention of incorrect chequebook issuance, and the alignment of account type and chequebook variant.\n\n##### Assumptions\nThe solution assumes that the gender code is accurately captured and maintained in the customer master data, and that the existing chequebook inventory management system can accommodate the new variant.\n\n##### Limitations\nThe solution has no significant technical or business limitations, as it is designed to work within the existing CBS infrastructure and technology.\n\n##### User Type or Capability Specifications\nThe solution does not require any specific user type or capability specifications, as it is designed to work with the existing teller interface and user roles.\n\n##### Maker Checker Specifications\nThe solution does not require any specific maker checker specifications, as it is designed to work with the existing approval and verification processes.\n\n##### Data Migration Applicability\nData migration is not applicable, as the solution involves enhancements to the existing database structure and validation logic.\n\n#### System Setup\n##### Parameter Table\nThe solution requires the following parameter settings:\n* ED1B: Information not provided in source documents.\n* ED2P: Information not provided in source documents.\n* ED3P: Information not provided in source documents.\n* Error Messages: Validation error messages will be displayed to the teller in case of incompatible selections or invalid data.\n* DB changes: The solution requires database structure enhancements to accommodate the new validation rule and mapping tables.\n\n#### References\n* Business Requirements Document (BRD) for Personalized Pink Coloured Chequebook for Female Corporate Salary Package Customers\n* Regulatory Document for GDPR Compliance Requirements\n\n#### Document Control\n##### Project Details\n* **Customer:** State Bank of India\n* **Project:** SBI CBS Development\n* **Document Name:** Solution Document for Personalized Pink Coloured Chequebook for Female Corporate Salary Package Customers\n\n##### Version History\n| Version | Date | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1.0 | 28 February 2026 | Initial version of the solution document |\n\n##### Sign Off\nThe solution document has been prepared by the Quality Assurance Team and is pending approval from the relevant stakeholders.",
